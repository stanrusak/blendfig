## blendplot (name taken, rename)

Python plotting library to be used with Blender to produce nice 3D plots.

## Example plots:

- Latticeasy heatmaps
- 2D surface
- Planck spectrum
- CMB map
- Chaotic pendulum
- COVID cases
- Stock market
- Map plots
- Vector field

## Plot types

- Scatter
- Line
- Surface
- Heatmap
- Histogram
- Bar chart
- Pie chart
- Error bars
- Map

## Inspiration:

Look in the literature and think how the existing plots could be made awesome.

# Features:

- From data file
- From pandas dataframe

## Things to think about

- Contours on 3D heatmap
- Bar legend gradient

## Fun demonstrations

- Cloth simulation
- Fluid simulation
- Image texture
- Higgs wearing the Higgs potential
- Sin(x^2+y^2) walking like a spider
